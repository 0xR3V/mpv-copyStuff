# mpv-copyTime
Copy the current time of the video to clipboard.

Get the current time of the video and copy it to the clipboard with the format HH:MM:SS.MS, where MS (milliseconds) is 3 digits.

By default, the script is bind to "Ctrl + c"

# Installation

## Windows
For Windows use copyTime.js or copyTime.lua, the one you prefere.

Put the selected script in your scripts folder (usually "%APPDATA%\mpv\scripts").

The script needs PowerShell to work.

## GNU/Linux

For GNU/Linux use copyTime-xclip.lua, that uses xclip instead of Powershell, thanks maxigaz.

Put copyTime-xclip.lua and copyTime-xclip.sh in your scripts folder (usually "~/.config/mpv/scripts/"). 

The script needs xclip to work.
